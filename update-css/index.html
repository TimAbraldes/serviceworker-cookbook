<body>
  <p>This page uses a ServiceWorker to make CSS assets available from a local cache; the browser does not have to wait for a response to a network request for the CSS assets before it displays the page.
  </p>

  <p>This page also demonstrates what happens when a new CSS file becomes available.
  </p>

  <p>The box below indicates what the SW served to this page in response to the request for 'style.css'. There are 2 styles available; yellow and blue. The button on this page can be used to simulate pushing an updated CSS file on the server. It will cycle between the yellow and blue styles. A black box below indicates that there was no SW installed when the page was loaded. Refresh the page to see a styled box appear.
  </p>

  <p>This example does not poll the server for new CSS files, but that could optionally be accomplished by sending Fetch Events from time to time from this page.
  </p>

  <p>This page does not auto-refresh the page when it discovers that a new CSS file is available; it simply displays a message to illustrate what is happening.
